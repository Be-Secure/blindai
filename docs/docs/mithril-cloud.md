# Mithril cloud

Mithril cloud is a fully managed version of BlindAI so that users donâ€™t need to worry about finding the hardware and setting up our solution to start experimenting with Confidential AI.

Now, uploading a model and querying it securely becomes trivial and can be done in a few lines of code, as shown in the [quickstart example](quick-start.md)

## Privacy guarantees

The BlindAI release hosted by Mithril Cloud is the 0.5.0.

Even though we are hosting the BlindAI instance, Intel SGX technologie and BlindAI's implementation gives you a way to be certain that the model and the data you send to the server is confidential. [Here](main-concepts/privacy.md) is a detailled explanation of the steps to take to ensure you are securely using Mithril cloud.
