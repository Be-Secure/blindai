An AI privacy solution to query models, while ensuring your data remains confidential every step of the way!

## What is BlindAI?
________________________________________________________

**BlindAI** is an **open-source solution** to query and deploy AI models while **guaranteeing data privacy**. The querying of models is done via our **easy-to-use Python library**.

Data sent by users to the AI model is kept **confidential at all times** by hardware-enforced **Trusted Execution Environments**. We explain how they keep data and models safe in detail [here](docs/getting-started/confidential_computing.md).

**BlindAi** consists of:

- **BlindAI API**: for querying popular AI models hosted by Mithril Security (with BlindAI Core running under the hood). Its a Python library üêç.

- **BlindAI Core**: for hosting your own BlindAI server instance in order to securely deploy your own models. It comes in two parts: a privacy-friendly **server** coded in **Rust** ü¶Ä using **Intel SGX** (Intel Software Guard Extensions) üîí and **AWS Nitro Enclaves** üå™Ô∏è to ensure your data stays safe and an easy-to-use **Python client SDK** üêç.

You can find our more about BlindAI and BlindAI.Core [here](docs/getting-started/blindai_structure.md).

> You can check out [the code on our GitHub](https://github.com/mithril-security/blindai/). 

We‚Äôll update the documentation as new features come in, so dive in!
