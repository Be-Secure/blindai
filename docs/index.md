## What is BlindBox?
________________________________________________________

**BlindBox** is a **privacy CLI tool** for **Docker images**. It will allow developers **to deploy** Software-as-a-Service (**SaaS**) **applications** with **guarantees** that their data and their users' will be **kept confidential during computation**. We use **secure enclaves** to encrypt the data end-to-end, **hardware based** and highly **isolated** environments. 

BlindBox is *COMING SOON.*

While we work on it, we prepared an **API demo** of a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to introduce what will go on under the hood of BlindBox.  

> You can check out [the code on our GitHub](https://github.com/mithril-security/blindbox/). 

We‚Äôll update the documentation as new features come in, so dive in!
