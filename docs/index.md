## What is BlindAI?
________________________________________________________

**BlindAI** is a **privacy solution** allowing developers to deploy their **Large Language Models** (LLM) SaaS solutions while **ensuring** user **data remains confidential** at all times.

Data sent by users to these models are kept **confidential at all times** by hardware-enforced **Trusted Execution Environments**. We explain how they keep data and models safe in detail [here](docs/getting-started/confidential_computing.md).

**BlindAi** consists of:

- **BlindAI API**: A Python library üêç for querying popular LLM models hosted by Mithril Security.

- **BlindAI CLI (coming soon)**: An easy-to-use CLI tool for application deployment in highly isolated environments called secure enclaves.

> You can check out [the code on our GitHub](https://github.com/mithril-security/blindai/). 

We‚Äôll update the documentation as new features come in, so dive in!
