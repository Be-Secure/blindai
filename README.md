## Setup testing remote attestation

### **Before running docker** 
The API key must be added on the `.devcontainer/default.json` to be ran with the PCCS. 

### **server side**
The remote attestation PoC is composed of two applications, one called the runner (path : `/runner`) and runs the runner for the enclave, and also the communication with the AESM service.  
The other one is the enclave (path : `./`). 
The run directly the enclave and runner with just type : 
```
just run 
```
it will generate the `manifest.dev.toml` and the `manifest.prod.toml` and it must print information about the quote and the collateral that has been generated by the runner. It should also open 2 sockets at 9930 & 9940 for the communication with the client. 

*PS : If the enclave exit while panicking, it may be because of an already used address.*

### **Client side**

Moving on to the client side example testing. 

```
# opening a new terminal 
# copying the generation file

cp manifest.dev.toml client/client/manifest.toml

cd client/client/
poetry run pip install -r requirements && poetry run pip install . 

# if the installation is successful, a new folder must have been created /lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib

# finally run the sample client example : 
poetry run python sample_client.py 
```

Printed information must appear verifying the different certificates. 

## AESM issue
The aesm doesn't run as a daemon inside docker for some reason. It must be installed outside on the host, and its socket is then linked into the docker. 

## Setup

First you need to connect to mithril docker registry (use the credentials you've received by email).
```
docker login registry.mithrilsecurity.io
```

Then run the "Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container..." command from the Command Palette or if available click on "Reopen in container" in the popup at the bottom-right of the window.

### Cargo integration with Fortanix EDP

`.cargo/config`  is already configured so that cargo can run SGX enclave. See the file for more information about the compilation options.

## Just command runner

Usual commands / recipes can be run with [just](https://just.systems/man/en/). 
```
$ just default
Available recipes:
    build *args        # Build for SGX target
    build-no-sgx *args # Build for a Linux target (no SGX)
    check *args        # Check for SGX target
    default
    run *args          # Run on SGX hardware
    run-no-sgx *args   # Run on a Linux target (no SGX)
    run-simu *args     # Run in the simulator
    valgrind *args     # Execute with valgrind instrumentation
```
Please refer to the justfile for details.

## Generate CA and certificates with OpenSSL CLI 
```
## Create a CA
# Generate an ECDSA secp256p1 private key
openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out ca.key
# Create a CA 
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -subj "/C=US/O=_Development CA/CN=Development certificates" -key ca.key -sha256 -days 3650 -out ca.pem 

## Create server certificate
# Generate server private key
openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out server.key

# Create a certificate signing request (CSR)
openssl req -new -subj "/C=US/O=Local Development/CN=localhost" -key "server.key" -out "server.csr"
# Use the previously created CA to sign the CSR to get the server certificate
# 
openssl x509 -req \
    -in "server.csr" \
    -extfile "server.ext" \
    -CA ca.pem \
    -CAkey ca.key \
    -CAcreateserial \
    -out "server.pem" \
    -days 365 \
    -sha256
# Convert key into PCKS8 DER format 
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -in server.key -out server2.key -nocrypt
```

## Run 

```
# Launch server in a terminal
$ cargo run
Now listening on port 9923 and 9924
-- (when running the python client)
Retrieve and send attestation report to client here
Retrieve and send attestation report to client here

/delete

# In another terminal test the server with a sample client
$ cd client
# The first time you need to export the distilbert model in onnx with
$ poetry run python client/distilbert_setup.py
# Then run the client
$ poetry run python client/sample_client.py

``` 

## Python Client

Dependencies are managed with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
Ressources:
  * Jupyter as a dev dependency : https://hippocampus-garden.com/jupyter_poetry_pipenv/

### Setup

```
cd client
poetry install --with=dev
```

### Run test

```
cd client
poetry run pytest -v
```
